imperial Rome was ill suited to courcy the unprcmeditated effusione of uulettered
herdenren. If l'irgil, therefore, has fallen very far short of his great prototypa,
the difficulty of his attempt must not be forgotten. indeed, he appears not in·
sensible of it himself ; and, hythe nature of the language iu which be composed,
he hasbeen compelled to abendon his original intention, and to attempt lofiier
fliglrts than tho nature of pastoral poetry strictly justifies.

The Eclogues of Virgil possess one remarkable characteristic3 they 8888118-
gories. This at once introduces a great differente between them and the Theo- Ι
eritean idyl. The allegorieal veil is sometimes allowed to fall, and tbe shepherds '·
who represent the poet and his friends converse like scholare and plrilosophers.
It has been a great 88881188,8118111881118Α1881888818188 of this figurative
character3 many are of opinion that it is merely an imitation of the Ἐραστὴς
81 Theocritus. All the grammaticus, however, identify the poet with Corydon3
and there is the bigher authority of his contemporary, Propertius, as well us
those of Martial and Apulejus, on the same side ;1 181 the real name of Alexis is
amatter of considerable doubt. The opinion mentioned by Servius, that Augustus .
was intended, scarcely deserves to be noticed. ‘Some make Alexis to have been
Alexander, a slave of Pollio; but most probably be belonged to ltaeoenas
Painful doubts overhang this portion of Virgil's history 3² but Juvenal most as- ·
suredly did not make any allusion to the subject in the following lines, which ¹
Dryden bas most grossly amplified and perverted :³-

-— si Virgilm puer et tolerabile deesset
Hospitium, caderent omnes e crinibus hydri,—
Surda nihil gemeret grave buccina.

There is difficulty iu helieving this to have been the first of Virgil's compositione,
on the supposition of Alexis being the slave either oi Maecenas or Augustus3
inasmuclr as, in that ease, it must bave been written beforewe have any account
of Virgil's acquaintance with either.

But the most extraordinary composition of Virgil is his Pollio, a poem which
