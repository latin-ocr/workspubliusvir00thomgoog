Catullus. One Epigram, intitulcd Votum pra suscepta AEuetde‚ will not bc
ungratesul tc the reader:

Si mihi susceptum inerit decurrere munus,
0 Paphon, ὃ sedes quae colis Idalias!
Troius AEneas Romana per oppida digno
dam tandem ut tecum* carmine vectus eat:
Non ogo thure modo, aut picta tua templa tabella
Ornabo, 01 puris serta feram manibus:
Corniger hos aries humiles 01 maxima taurus
Victima sacratos tinget honore focos3
Marmoreusque tibi, Dea, versicoloribus alis,
’ In morem picta stabit Amor pharetra
Adsis, ὃ Cytherea! tuus te Gaesar Olympo,
Et Surrentini litoris ora vocant.

lt is scarcely necessary to distinguish the Catalecta from the Epiprarnmcta.
The nature 01 the Priapeia it is obviously unnecessary to investigate. Tba
work now extant under that title is, substantially‚ Augustae, but the character
01 Virgil forbids ns to suppose that his pen baa contributed to it in any im-
portant degree. The Dirp is a poem attributed more correotly to Valerius

(lato. The Marcium is a pieac 01 very peculias beauty3 and approaches neate
to Theocritus in spirit than any 01 the Bucolica. It bears also a remarkable
resemblance 10 Bloomtield's Farmer’a Boy. It is a lively description 01 0 rustic'c
day, and takes its name 110111 0 kind of salad, called Moretum, the making 01
which is described in it. The Copais a bacchanalium invitation, in the person ,
010 Capu, or Syrian woman, who attended, as a dancer 01 ringer, cn houses 01
public entertainment-“ Ambubaiarum colleyia.''

01 011 the minor poems, however, ascribed to virgil, the Culex is, 101 many
reasons, tbe best deserving notice. Whatever doubts may be thrown on 1110
genuineness 01 the others, there seems to be every reason 101 believing tbat this
poem, allowiug 101 all its grass and mauisold corruptions, is the work 01 virga.
Tbat Virgil wrote a poem bearing this name cannot be questioned ; 101, besides
the testimony 01 Donatus and Servius, we have the more respectable evidcuou
01 11011101,1 Statius,2 and Lucan,³ 1011110 1001. Donatus quotes two verses from
the poem, and Nouius Marcellus one, which 010 found in the extant mpies.
The poem, however, seems to bavo suffered much from alterations and inter·¹
peltaticns. dllowing 101 these, it must have been a very beautiful productiori,
and by far the most original effort of Virgil's blase. It opens with a dedication
tc Octavius; who this Octavius was is amatter 01 uncertainty. ln the Cata·
lecta mention is made 01 0 certain Octavius who died in a paroxysm 01 anger
occasioned by drinking; if this person be, 00 some commentatore suppose, the
