Hs erected statues representing various nations; and, when any nation was about
to revolt against the Emperor, the corresponding statne rang a small bell, and
gave warning ιο arm for the contest. As be advsncsd in years, hc became
desirons of renovating his youth by enclrantment3 and, with this victv, erected a
aastls in a lonely spot, in the perch of which hs sct twenty-four copper statues,
armsd with iron flails, twelve on each side, which tlrreshed continnally, except
when he withheld them. Hither he conducted a servant3 and, leading him into
a roorn lightcd by a perpetual lamp, bads hirn hill lrim, cut tho body in pisces,
and place it in a barrel, lor the oil os the lamp ιο drop upon for nine days, atter
which Virgil was to coms forth a youth. Tho lamp was, notwithstanding, ιο
be replenished dsily. Tlrs instructions were complied with. The servant was
made acquainted with the method of stopping the flails, and visited the apart-
ment every day ιο replenish the lamp. At length the Emperor, missing Virgil
from murt, threatened the servant with death if hs did not courcy him ιο his
master. When the domestic had led the Emperor ιο the enehanted room, and
had confessed his deed, the prince slew him on the spot. The figure of a little
child was sorthwitb seen running round the barsel, exclaimiug, ‘⁶ Curscd be the

tirno that ys ever came hers.” The replenishing of tho lamp being suspended, Ι

the renovation was incompleta and the magician poet died.

Such is a specimen of the extraordinary absurdities wherewith mediaeval
writes have overlaid the biography oi Virgll. It is, however, bnt a very slight
uouce ol the mythology connected with the subject. Many fabulous inventione
aro omitted, and those which have been addnccd have beon merely sketched, as
some readers may dcem even these slendcr particulare unworthy of allusion in a
serlone though compendions biography. They have, however, in the writer's
opinion, their valae-they show the high reputation which the name of Virgil
hsd attainsd even when his works were least appreciated; for magical powers
weretbsn ascribed in proportiones intellectual were exhibited3 and though
Virgil's mathematical and physical studies may have had possibly some influence
in originating the fablcs reported of him, yet the general celebrity of his writings,
tbejndgmsnt of ancient critice, and the estimats which the learned were still

able ιο form of his vorke, are sufficient to account for the phenolnenon. These
tales, in truth, only speak the langrrage of one to whom they perhaps were, and ’
lbelr subject cenainly was, amply familiar:

“ Glorie and honour, Virgils Msntuan,
Be to thy name!’'¹
