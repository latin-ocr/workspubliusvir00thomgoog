has been the subject of endless conjecture. The much litigated and unsettled
question, “whom was it intended to commemorate?'’ we shall pass over, as
not materially connected with our subject ; only observing that this honour has
been ascribed to the young Marcellus, to a son of Pollio, to a son of Augustus,
to Asinius Gallus, to Drusus, and lastly, even to Augustus himself.¹ ll'hatis
principally worthy of notice is, that this poem exlribits a coincidence with the
&cred Writings too close to be sortuitous. That the Greeks bad aceyoired in-
directly some acquaintance with the histories os the Hebrew Scriptures is uot to
he doubted; as Hesiod and Ovid, tho expounders of their theology‚ have clearly Ι
discovered it, and it is probable that Theocritus, at the court os Ptolemy, had
seen the Sacred Volumc, and even horrowed its phraseology.⁸ But in this poem
Virgil only imitated Theocritus iu the structure of the composition3 lor, with ons
or tvvo exceptione, there is no similarity iu details, which in Virgil resemble au
epitome of Scripture prophecies of the Messiah. Though much of the fabulous
history ol the early world is corrupted from Holy Scriptura, the Greeks in general
were ignorantes its source, and were too much possessed with a contempt for
‘⁸ harhudau” literature to study‚ much less to imitate, the Hebrewwriters. The
universal contempt entertained for the Jews at Rome made it still less probable
that their literature would meet imitation, or even perusal‚ there. An intelligent

hut to this it is only necessary to reply‚ that the line cited was not written until
mer the Pollio was composed The inquiror must, therefore, advauee ou other
ground than that of supposing that Virgil accommodated the prophetie Scriptures
to his purpose· The poet has, indeed, given us a clue in our inquiries; he has
asserted that his prophecies are taken t‘rom the verses of the Cumoean Sibyl.
The fable of the Sibyl‘s interview with Tarquin is well known. The books which
she was supposed to have given to the Romans were destroyed in the conflagra-
tion of the Capitol during the Marsian war3 emissaries were then despatched by
the Senate throughout Italy, Greeee, Asia, and the coasts of Africa, to col-
lect thc best authenticated prophecies of the various Sibyls3 and the collection
thus made was called ‘⁴ Cumoeum Cormeu,'’ because it was compiled to supply
thelose ol' the writings of the Cumaeau sibyt In this miseellany itisnothingim-
prohable that prophecies of the great Person then about to appear should be found,
