rae fact was, that a more effectual and more delicate expedient for calling tho
atterrtion of Angustus to this important subject could not be imagined3 and in
his power lay a great portion of the remedy.

0f the character of the Georgica it is unnecessary ιο speak, because no
mador of this memoir can bc ignorant that this poem is the most elaborate and
cxbaordinary instance of the power of genius in embellishing a most barren
subiect, which human wit bas ever affordcd. The comruonest precepts of
sarming are delivered with an elegance which could scarcely be attaiued bya
post who should endeavour ιο clothe in verse the sublimest maxims of philo·
sophy. Indeed‚ one consideration alone is sufficient to show us the excellence
of Virgil in this particular-the unisorm failure of his imitators. Itis, however,
nach to be regretted that hc was not free to choose his own subject, as, in all
probability, he would have selected a theme better suited to his Musa It is
said that the poet, while employed on this immortal work, composed many
auses every morniug; bnt, by the evening, reduced thern to a very few; so

According to the computation of Donatus, or the writer of the Life cf Virgo
ascribed to him, the poet must have been at Naples‚ after six years’ attention
ιο the Georgica, when Angustus undertook the expedition against hntony,
which ended in the decisive victory of Actium. To the year following that
engagement the completion os the Georgius is commonly assigned. At what
hmo the AEaeid was first projected‚ is uncertain3 but virgil, like our Milton,
appears from a very early periono have had a strong desire of composing an
ep'a poem, and, libe him also, to have beon long urrdecided on his subJect.
· hut he had attempted something of the kind, before the Eclogues were finishcd,
hsvident from these verses in his Silenus:

Quhm canerem repes et malm, Cynthius aurern
Vellit, ct admonuit,—

' uo bis ambition to produce some work of distinguished excellence is attested
bytho ardent exclamation in the opening of the Illd Georgia:

Tentanda via est, qud me qaoque possim
Tollere humo, victorque virum volitare per ora.

hren in his Cales, which he is said to have written at fifteen years of ago, lrc
gives promise of higher things ε

’ Posterihs gravime sono tihi Musa loquetur
Nostra, dabunt quhnr securos mihi ternpore fructds
Ut tibi digna tuo poliuntur carmina sensu.
