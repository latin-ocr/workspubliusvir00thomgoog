Catalectu were, according 10 Donatus’s account, completed when Virgil was
1111000 years 01 age.¹ From the dedication, the poet proceeds 10 0 10001 glowing

though less polished, is more winning and pathetie than the corresponding
passage in the Georgica He has not, indeed, surpassed in intensity 01101101101

’110 character 01 Vugil, as drawn by Asconius Pedianus, and preserved to ns
hyllonatua, is emiuently pleasing. He 10 11010 represented as kind in disposition,
