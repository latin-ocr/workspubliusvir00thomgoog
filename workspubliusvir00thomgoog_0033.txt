XXX BIOGRAPHIOAL MEMOIB OF VIRGIL.

Carvilius Pictor, in imitation of his worthy prototype Zoilus, composed an
AEneidomostir. Bavius and Maevius, proverbial names for the impersonation
ol united dulness, envy, and calumuy‚ attached Virgi13 aud Comilicius, also,
appears to have written against him. Virgil is said to have retaliated undar ,
the name of Amyntas, in his Alexis and Daphnis.1 But the most triumphant
refutation of his adversaries has been the judgmeut of posterity. No urim,
probably, ever exercised so wide an influenoe either in time or space. His work·
became lorthwith,² and still remaiu, text-books and school-books; they were even Ι '
translated into Grcck; thoy were commented on by a cloud of grammaticum
they were the subject ol innumerable epigrams3 they were formed into centos3
they wcre used for the purposes os divination. Virgil was the model of ilie
Carlovingian poets; the “Magnus Apollo” of the chivalrous Von Veldeclr5
Dante exulted in his guidance; and the later poetry of all Europeans has dom
homage to his supremacy.

In person, according to Donatus, Virgil was tall; his complexion was dari,
his expression rustic, his manners shy, aud ol almost feminine modesty. Thoe
particulare may very well be traditional. hllusion has been already made to the
magical powers ascribed to him, and, as a matter of curiosity, and illustrative Ι
of the ideas which prevailed concerniug him in the middle ages, some of them J
sables may be appended. Nono of them are probably older than the llth oen-
tury. According, theu, to his mediaeval clironiclers,l⁷irgil became acquaintcd with
necromaucy by thc assistance of an evil spirit, who promised to instruct him in .'
the art so that hc should never bc surpassed, on condition os being liberated stom
a caveru iu thc side of a hill in which he was confined· Virgil sullilled the cen·
dition, and afterwards defied the spirit to enter the hole at which bs came ont '
The challenge was accepted3 but no sooner was the demon in the cave tim
Virgil closed it upon him. The story is probably derived from an hrabian tra·
dition. Virgil’s first necromantic exploit was the erection of the city of Naphs,
which he built ona foundation os egge. On a square tower which he constructori ·
there, he so balanced an agg, that, when it stirred, the city would be sbalren vritlr
an earthquake; and, whenever it broko, the city would sink. He made, and placed
on one of the gates of his lavouritc town, afly of coppcr, which prevented all
living illes from eutering the city. On a mount near that place, he set upa
statne of the same metal, with a trumpet in its mouth, which, when the north
wind blevv, drove the lire and· smoke from ‘⁶ thc lorges of Vulcan ’⁹ with great nobo
to the sea. Hc made a public lire, near which he erected a brazen archer with
bended bon, beneath which was inscribed: “ Whoever strilres me, Ishoot my
arrow.” hmaniac defied the warning, when the statue discharged his arrow
into the lire, aud extinguished it. He surronnded his house and gurdon with an
mmovable atmosphere‚ so that it never rained within the charmed enclosure.
