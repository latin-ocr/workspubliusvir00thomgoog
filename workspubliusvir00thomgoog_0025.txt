ing ιο common repon, to a certain Maximinian, who flourished in the time of
Boetius. lte en elegiae poet, Gallus ranked very high in public opinion. Ovid
speaks of his saure as universal; Propertius and Martial have borne testimony
to hie excellence3 and Virgil, in his beautiful and extraordinery vnn Eclogue,
hae panegyrined his Euphorion in the noblest etrains oi mythological eulogy.
Virgil had also, according to Servius, celebrated bis praises iu the conclusion of
hie Georgius. Gallus was no less distinguished as a warrior than es a poet3 he
was oi great service to Augustus in the Egyptian war, and assisted in eecurmg
the person of Cleopatra. He was, in consequence, constituted the first prefect
of Egypt. Here bc appears ιο bave conducted himself with arrogance and in·
eolence. He was afterwards condemned to banishment by the command oi
Augustus, on suspiciones having conspired against him3 a sentence which, how-
ever, the poet anticipated by a voluntary death, uc. 7283 and Virgil, at the
instance of the emperor, substituted ior his eulogy on Gallus the fable of Aris·
icens.

The publication of Virgil’s Bucolics created a powerful sensation in literary
Rome The grammarians tell us that they were recited on the stage;¹ and
theton one occasion, when Cicero was present in the theatre‚ and heard some ’

verses oi the Silenus recited by Cytheris, he called for the whole eclogae, and,
when he had heard it through, erclaimed, “hlopnae spes ultera Romaerl

This cannot be true, for Cicero was theu dead: but we bave better authority
sor the truth os the honours publicly lavished on Virgil. From the author of the
Dialogue de Oratoribus* weelearu that, when some verses oi Virgil were recited
on the stage, and the poet happened to be present, all the spectatore rose, aud
psid him the same marks of respect which they would bave shown to Augustus.
Propertius³ hae celebrated tbe conclusion and publication of the Bucolice, end
Ouid⁴ has foretold their immortality.

The poetical power which the Bucolics discovered induced Maecenas, almost
as soon as they were finished (about uc. 717), to requeet Virgil to undertake
the Georgics. The neglected etate of agriculture, in consequence of the civil
ware, might be the reason why Maecenas chose this subject for Virgil's Muse:

aud indeed this condition ol the country is graphically described by the poet
himself :⁶

Ubi fas versa atque nefas3 tot belle per orbem,
Tam multae scelerum iacies: non ullus aratro
Dignus honos: squalent obductis arva colonis,
Et curva rigidum sulces conflantur in ensem.

But we must not suppose the stateeman to have conceived that the military
settlere could be moved by, an exquisite poem to the cultivation oi their estates.
