and there can be no doubt that the samo ingenuity, had this line followed those
above cited, would have given an equally convincing interpretationes Tauris.
Any mind unsopbisticated by hypothesis cannot fail to perceive that the poet is

iuoithg a timo of universal opulence and rest, when agriculture and commerce
dauid be aliie unnecessary: and when the ram in tlte mendosos (not in the
skins), should wear his tieeoo, without the dyer's labour, attirod in tbe most
mady aud splendid oolonrs.¹

Tbat tho Daphnis was composed, like Milton's Lycidas, to commemorate
tha death of mmo real person, is scarcely to be doubted. That Menalcas repre-
sents Virgil is evideut from tho conclusion, whereiu he states himself to be the
author of two of Virgil's Eologues. Mopsus, according to Servius, isAEmilius
Macer of Verona, who wrote a poetioal history oi serpente, plauts, and birds, in
imitation of Nicander, and a supplement to tho Iliad, called Aniehomorioo and
Posihomerico. Bernhardy, Biibr, and others, after llemsdorf, attribute, how·
ever, tho epio and diductio poems to different writers oi the samo namo.2 Ii
Daphnis bs a personificatiou, Julius Caesar is the only person whom the character
oan pourtray, as Heyne justly observes: although ho believes the poem to be
merely acommemcration of the celebrated Siciliau shepherd. Servius and
Donatus make Daphusa the poet’s brother Flaccus. An uncertain epigrammatist
has the following distich:

Tristia iata tui dum fles in “ Daphnide '' Flacci,
Docte Maro, fratrem Dis immortalibus aequas

virgil concluded his Bucolica with an elegant compliment to Cornelius Gallus,
a celebrated contemporary poet, born at Forum Julii, in (laubabunt Virgil's
own age, and his tellau-papii underfiyron, consoling him for the loss of bis
Lycoris, whom the old commentatore assert to bave been au aemma, wboso real
name was Cytheris. She was the heedwoman of Volumnius Eutrapelus, and took

have supposed that she deserted Gallus to accompany Antony on his Gallio
expedition. Heyne, however, in bis argument of tho Gallus, bas shown, hom
chronological considerations, tbat this could not be the caso. The genuine poems
of Gallus, with the exception of a t'ew fragments, arc lost. They consisted of
four boolts ct elegies, offlcd Amores or Lycoris, and a translation oi Euphorion,
as we learn srom Servius. Apretendcd edition of the works of Gallus was pub·
