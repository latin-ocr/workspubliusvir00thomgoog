pemons ol education. Most scholare are agreed that it wants the natural
lrashness and freedom of Homer, while it exhibita a degree of art, eleganoe, and
majesty never attempted in any poem, save the Georgica ol its author. lt may,
honera, he pertinent to remark, that, smooth and nnisorm as its surfaoe seems,
itis really, in great measure, mosaic. That Virgil should have translated whole
passages out of Homer, or even the Alexandrino writers, is no matter of cen·
aaa: ha and his contemporaries would have thought the absenceos such
“ purpurei panni '' a deseot; and the high authorities of Dante, hriosto, Tasso,
humer, Gamoeus, and Milton ratisy their opinion. But the same cannot be
aldof plagiarisms srom Latin authors. How unsompulouslysshe appropriated
whole verses of Ennius, os Lucretius, of Lucilius, of even his friend Varius, and
ol others, the carious reader may find in the Vlth Book of Macrobius's Soter·
acdo,which will abundantly repay his perusel. His merit, therefore,in not

mtwgreat as Donatus would have us believe. It maybe right to add that

wuian reeearch os its illustrious author.

[¹hvailing himself of the pride and superstitiones the Roman people, which
rerer ahounded more than during the Augustan age, the poet traces the origin
and establishment of the “ eternal city ” to those heroes and actious which had
enough in them of what was human and ordinary to excite the sympathy of his
oomtrymen3 intermingled with persons and circumstances of an extraordinary
and superhuman character, to awaken their admiration and their awe. No
subject could have been more happily chosen. It has been admired too for its
perseot unity of action3 sor while the episodes command the richest variety of
deruption, they are always subordinated to the main object of ths'poem, which
isto impress the divine authority under which AEneas first settled in Italy. The
urath of J nno, upon which the whole fate of AEueas seems at first suspended, is

donce that of a woman and a goddess: the passion of Dido, aud her general
' chmacter, hringus nearer the present world, but the poetis continuallyintro·
docing higher and more effectual influences, until, by the interventiones the
ther of gods and meu, the Trojan name is to be continued in the Roman, and
thus heaven and earth are appeared.

Hinc genua, Ausonio mixtum quod sanguiue surget,
Supra homines, supra iro Deos pietate videbis3
Nec gens nlla tuos reque celebrabit honores.
