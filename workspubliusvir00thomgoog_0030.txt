monumnenta MEMOIR OF VIRGIL. XXVll

toamng to Donatus bs composed his epitaph, to be inscribed on bis tomb at
ψ llsplee, whither he desired bis body to be conreyed for burial:

Mantua me genuit3 Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc
Parthenope3 cecini pascus, rura, duces.

’ ns internal evidence militates ioroibly against the ascriptiou of these verses.
lugd was, however, buried (by order of Augustus, Donatus seya) in the road
, lton Naples to Pulteoli, within two miles of the former place. On his death-bed
J bmnestly desired that his AEnes‘d, as an imperfect work, might be burned,
⁵ tud even left in his will an injunction to that effect. Being, however, informed
, bytho celebrated Varius and Plotius Tucca, (the same who is mentioued by
l lloraoe, in his jouruey to Brundusium) that Augustus would not permit the
motion of bie poem, he lest it to them to publish, on condition that they
roto make no additions to the text, even for the purpose of supplying an
¹ pirnted verse. How far his executore were faithful to their trust must now
ltunoertain3 several uniinished verses are extant in the AEneid,· but the
nutatione of some complete lines render it not improbable that they have
been supplied by another pcnss The biography and the writings of Virgil have,
wlortunntely, fallen into the hands‘of ignorant grammarians and monastica, who
lere most miserably corrupted both. Asample of the absurd legende with which
mo of his biographers have dishgured his history shall be presently offered to ·
mortona reader. The corruptions of his writings are chiefly to be found in
lbninor poema. Donatus, presenting us with some occasional verses, which
iuternal aud external evidences alike repudiate,¹ mentions, as bis aekuowledged
roris, the Cotolecto, the Moratum, the Priapeia, the Epiyrorrra, the Dirae,
tndtbe Culea5 and notices a poem called AEtno, tbe genuineness of ulrich he
tonsiders doubtful. This poem is to be found, illustrated with copious disserta·
born, and noticee of the authors to whom it has been ascribed, in the fourth
mune oi Wemsdorf’s Poe'toe Minores, where it is attributed to Lucilius Junior,
aurita of the time of Nero. To these, Servius adds the Cirino, which is ths
une aith the Ciris (a poem with sorus plausibility ascribed to Catullus) and
lle Copo. The Catalecto are miscellaneous little poema, mostly in the style of

¹llenray possibly except the epitaph on Ballsta, Vlrgll‘s schoolmaster, who war stoned ior his
Mese ·

Monte sub hoe lapidum tegitur Balista sepultus3
Nocte, die, tutnni, carpe, viator, iter.
