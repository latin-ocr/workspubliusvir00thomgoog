The style, for sweetuess and for beanty, occasionally, and in the autborla
finished passages, surpasses almost every other productiori of antiqnity. ‘⁶ Ι see
no foundation,” says Dr. Blair, “for the opinion entertained by some aritia
that the AErreid is ιο bc considered as an allegorical poem, which carries a con·
stant reference to tbe character and reign of Augustus Caesam or that Virgil's
main design in composing the AEneid was to reconcile the Romans to the
govemmcnt of that prince, who is supposed to be shadowerl ont under thr
character of AEneas ..... Ηο had sufficient motives, as a poet, to determino
him to the choico cf bis subject, from its being in itselfboth great and pleasing3
from its being suited tobis genius, and its being attended with peculiarsd-
vantages for the full display of poetical talents.” ¹

The first six books of the AEneid are the most elaborate part of the poem.
The imperfectioris of the AEner‘d are alleged to be want of originality in some

rather than that of AEneas3 and to which the exquisite soenes sor displaying
the tenderness of the poet in narrating the story of Lavinia, seem to have boon

ardour not disproportionate, Horace addressed the ship which bore his departing
friend :— '

Sic te Diva potens Cypri,
Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
Ventorumque regat pater,
Obstrictis allis, praeter Iapyga,

Navis, qnae tibi creditum
Debes Virgilium, finibus Atticis

Reddas incolumem, precor,
Et serves animae dimidium meael ²

Αι Athens the poet met with Augustus, who was retuming from Samos, where
he had wintered after his Syrian expedition, to Rome. changing his former
